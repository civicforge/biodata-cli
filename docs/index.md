# Welcome to BioData CLI

## What is BioData CLI?

**BioData CLI** is a command-line tool that helps researchers, conservationists,
and data professionals index, search, and manage large collections of spatial and
biodiversity datasets.

It allows users to quickly understand what data they have, where it is, what
format it’s in, and how it can be used, without the need for specialized GIS software.

## Why Does It Exist?

Around the world, individuals and organizations working on critical environmental
and ecological issues are buried under datasets they can barely organize, let
alone use effectively.

- Files are in different formats, projections, and folders.
- There’s no easy way to know which files are usable or relevant.
- Valuable datasets go unused simply because no one can find them or understand
what they contain.

Most solutions today are built for power users, locked behind complex GIS tools,
or trapped in private systems.

**BioData CLI exists to break that barrier.**

## How Does It Help?

BioData CLI gives users a simple interface to:

- **Index** large directories of spatial and tabular data
- **Search** datasets by format, geometry type, projection, and more
- **Inspect** metadata like bounding boxes, row counts, and column structure
- **Tag** datasets for easy discovery and reuse
- **Export** metadata summaries for reports or collaboration

It brings clarity and control to those working on complex data challenges —
especially in environments with limited resources.

## Vision

To make working with spatial and biodiversity data as intuitive, efficient, and
open as possible — for everyone.

We envision a world where:

- No important dataset is lost in a folder
- No team is blocked by confusion over file formats or projections
- Anyone, anywhere, can organize and understand their data without expensive
software or deep technical training

---

## Mission

To build a reliable, open, and user-friendly command-line tool that helps
individuals and teams manage spatial data with confidence.

We aim to support the work of conservationists, researchers, data journalists,
and community scientists by reducing friction and unlocking the potential of the
datasets they already have.

BioData CLI is built to be lightweight, understandable, and long-lived — software
that quietly supports big, meaningful work.
